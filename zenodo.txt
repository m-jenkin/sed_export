Data analysed in the article: Subglacial sediment export from an Alpine glacier
DOI:

OVERVIEW:
- Data on water discharge and sediment export in the main proglacial river at the Glacier d'Otemma, ~0.3 km   downstream of the glacier terminus, for the years 2020, 2021 and 2022. Subsets of these data were previously published for 2020 and 2021 (Müller and Miesen 2022; Mancini et al. 2023), but are provided here in full, and extended into 2022.
- Air temperature and precipitation data are those published in Müller (2022) for 2020 and 2021, with a 16-day gap filling in 2020 (see Supporting Information to main article), and the timeseries is extended here into 2022 (Sept 16).
- Snow cover and snow line altitude data from satellite image classification.
